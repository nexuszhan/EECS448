# Antiwork Tendency Prediction

This project was carried out during the course Human-centered Machine Learning. The user interface is built with a Python library named Tkinter. The interface has basic input and ouput functions while enabling selection of two prediction models. When RNN model is selected, the interface can highlight some words with significant attribution for the prediction result. With this interface, it's possible to better analyze someone's tendency to antiwork. 

You can try playing with the UI by downloading the compressed file.
