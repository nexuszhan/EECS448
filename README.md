# Antiwork Tendency Prediction

This project was carried out during the course Human-centered Machine Learning. The user interface is built with a Python library named Tkinter. The interface has basic input and ouput functions while enabling selection of two prediction models. When RNN model is selected, the interface can highlight some words with significant attribution for the prediction result. With this interface, it's possible to better analyze someone's tendency to antiwork. 

The interface.py only contains codes implementing the interface, which cannot run without the files containing model. However, due to ethical concerns, we cannot open source the classification models. If you really wish to have the complete code, please reach out us via zsynexus@umich.edu and explain why you need it. Thank you.
